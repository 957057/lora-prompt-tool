# LoRA Model Prompt Tool

LoRA Model Prompt Tool is my favorite prompt assistant extension, but it hasn't been updated since the dev branch of sd-webui updated new feature 'extra-networks-tree-view' in Jan until the release of version 1.8, so I try do it myself to preliminarily support sd-webui v1.8.
